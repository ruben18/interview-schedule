# Assignment

For this assignment please use the **tech stack** requested in the email that was sent to you.
If no tech stack was defined, we would suggest to use [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) coupled with [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/) and [**Symfony**](https://symfony.com/).

## Build an interview calendar UI and API
There may be two roles that use this app, a candidate and an interviewer. A typical scenario is when:

- An interview slot is a 1-hour period of time that spreads from the beginning of any hour until the beginning of the next hour. For example, a time span between 9am and 10am is a valid interview slot, whereas between 9:30am and 10:30am is not.
  
- Each of the interviewers sets their availability slots. For example, the interviewer Ines is available next week each day from 9am through 4pm without breaks and the interviewer Ingrid is available from 12pm to 6pm on Monday and Wednesday next week, and from 9am to 12pm on Tuesday and Thursday.

- Each of the candidates may then schedule an interview based on the previously inserted slots. For example, the candidate Carl checks when the interviewers are available next week, and he schedules the interview with Ingrid at 12pm, because that is when both are available.
